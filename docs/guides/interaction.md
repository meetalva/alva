# Guide 4 - Interaction

:woman_student: **Level**: Beginner

---

In this guide you will learn how to link pages and bring life into your prototype.

## 1. Add Page
On the left side of Alva all of the pages are shown. Let’s **add a page** and give it a name.

## 2. Add Button
We need an interactive component. Let’s **add a button**, for example.

> Technical Note: For Interactive Elements you need an `React.MouseEventHandler`or `React.EventHandler` property.

## 3. Link Page
Below the usual button properties such as Order or Disabled, you’ll find an **Interaction Property**. **Set it to** `Switch to Page` and **select the page** you want to link to below. That’s it!

## 4. Click
Well, because usually when you click on an element in the preview it gets selected, we have to test our interaction differently. **Hold *CMD* on macOS or *Ctrl* on Windows and click on the Button**. Yay, you just switched to the other page! After exporting your prototype you won’t need to hold those keys anymore.
