The registration for our newsletter takes place in a so-called double opt-in procedure. This means that you will receive an e-mail after registration, in which you will be asked to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can log on with foreign e-mail addresses. The registrations for the newsletter are recorded in order to be able to prove the registration process according to legal requirements.
