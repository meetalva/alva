# Get started

In this guide you'll start your first Alva project and connect a publicly available component library.

---

## 1. Download and install

Download the Alva image appropriate for your platform from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/meetalva/alva/releases). 

We fully support macOS and Windows systems and provide untested images for various Linux platforms.

Next, locate the Alva image in your Downloads and double-click on the file to start the installation process.

## 2. Start Alva

Alva should install into your applications folder. Depending on your operating system and
its configuration the exact location may vary. E.g. for macOS it is `/Applications/Alva`. 

Find the Alva logo and double-click it to start. Alva should greet you with the following screen:

## 3. Create a new file and connect a library

Click on `Create File` and then switch from `Design` to `Library` view in the top left panel. You find a continously growing list of  public component libraries.

Locate the `Alva Website Design` library and click on `Connect`.

That’s it – you connected your first Design System with Alva!

## 4. Add a text component
 Go back to the `Design` view. You find the library's components in the bottom left panel. Locate the `Text` component and drop it onto the element pane right above the component list.

## 3. Adjust a Property
After you've selected the newly added text component, have a look at the right side of Alva. That is where all the **properties** – like settings – of the component are shown. In our case there is just a single one – the text value. Let’s **change** that to `Hello Alva!`.

## 4. Add a Box Component
Let’s add another component. Besides dragging a component, we can just double-click on the **Box Component**. The Box Component has way more properties. Let’s change the `height` to `400px` and the **background-color** to `#DA046E`.

## 5. Re-Order Elements
As you may have already found out, elements that support children elements have a small arrow on the left side. You can drag and drop elements into them. Let’s **move the text element into the box element**!

### Next
Hooray! You learned the essentials of working with Alva. Let’s jump to the next topic – how to integrate your design drafts into the prototype.
