# Guide 6 - Create a Pattern

:woman_student: **Level**: Intermediate

Learn how to add our own component to Alva.

## Prerequesites

Make sure you have the following software 
installed on your machine.

* :evergreen_tree: [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* :turtle: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 8`
* :computer: A terminal emulator 
* :globe_with_meridians: Internet connection


## 1. Setup up Alva Design Library

> ❔
> In this guide we'll skip the project setup
> part by reusing the Alva Design Library. 
>
> If you want to start fresh, skip to our [Create a Library Guide](./create-library.md)

Please make sure to follow our [Connnect a Library Guide](./library) before 
continuing with step 2.

## 2. Add a Hello World component

!(video:https://media.meetalva.io/video/add-hello-world.m4v)

Open your favorite text editor in the Alva Design Library folder you just 
connected to Alva. We'll show [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in screenshots and videos but any text editor will do.

Let's create a new folder called "Hello World" with an `index.tsx` file in it:


> `mkdir src/hello-world && touch src/hello-world/index.tsx`

Add the following code to it. It is a simple React component rendering "Hello, World!" into an `<h1>` tag:

```ts
import * as React from 'react';

export const HelloWorld: React.SFC = () => {
	return (
		<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
	)
}
```

!(video:https://media.meetalva.io/video/export-hello-world.m4v)

This won't do anyhting on its own in Alva just yet. Let's add our brand new component to `src/index.ts` to change that:

```ts{4}
/** lines omitted */
export * from './space';
export * from './teaser';
export * from './hello-world';
```

## 3. Build your changes

For Alva to understand your new code you need to build it with the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) compiler.
Let's do that real quick. Execute the following command in your Alva Design Library folder.

```
npm run build
```

When TypeScript is done translating your code the terminal window should resemble this:

```
λ npm run build

> meetalva-designkit@1.0.0 build /Users/marneb/Documents/alva/alva-design
> tsc

~/alva/alva-design
λ
```

We are all set, let's switch back to Alva.

## 4. Update Alva Design Library in your Alva project

!(video:https://media.meetalva.io/video/update-library.m4v)

Start Alva and open the project you created while working through the [Connect a Library Guide](./library). 

Open the "Libraries" Tab. On the `Alva Website UI` card hit the "Update" button. Wait for the card to switch back from "Connecting" to "Connected".


## 5. Use the Hello World component

!(video:https://media.meetalva.io/video/use-hello-world.m4v)

Let's put our component to use! Click on the search bar above
the pattern list and type in "Hello World" (without quotation marks).

You should now see "Hello, World" into your preview, rendered by your very first component connected to Alva. 

Congratulations! :tada:
