In this guide you will learn how to integrate your freshest design drafts into your prototype.

## 1. Export a design component
**Export** a design component from your favorite design tool – like Sketch, Figma or Photoshop – as SVG, PNG or JPG.

## 2. Add an Image Component
Add the *Image* Component from the *Essentials* library and drag it onto the element list above.

## 3. Upload your design component
After selecting the component, you’ll see an Image property on the right side. Click on "Select" and then select your exported file.

## 4. Set the image size
You can adjust the size of your component and even define minimum or maximum sizes. For example, your component can be 80% width, but at maximum 1280px.
