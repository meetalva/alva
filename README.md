# Meet Alva

> Create living prototypes with code components
>
> https://meetalva.io


# [Get Started](https://meetalva.io/doc/docs/guides/start?guides-enabled=true) | [Let's chat](https://gitter.im/meetalva/Lobby) | [Website](https://meetalva.io)

Start with a minimal set of components to sketch concepts and iterate fast your team to create and enrich components, refine design and implemenation and compose a working, living prototype.

### Getting Started with Alva

> üë©‚Äçüéì **Audience**: Everyone

* Follow the [installation instructions](#installation)
* Start Alva
* Click "Create A New Alva File"
* Drag some elements from the pattern pane (bottom left) to the element pane (top left).
* Download the [example file from meetalva.io](https://meetalva.io/Example.alva)
* Open it by hitting `Cmd+O`, then select the downloaded `Example.alva`
* Notice how the the pattern pane has new entries? That is a production-level pattern library embedded in `Example.alva`!


### Connect a Pattern Library to your Project

> üë©‚Äçüéì **Audience**: Everyone

* Start Alva
* Click "Create A New Alva File"
* Click the "Connect" button (top right)
* Select a directory that contains a [compatible pattern library](#pattern-library-requirements)
* Alva adds all found components to the pattern list (bottom left)

> :information_source: Alva currently supports a limited set of pattern libraries. See [Pattern Library Requirements](#pattern-library-requirements) for details. 
>
> Consult with your team members if your library fulfills the requirements.
>
> Use the [Alva DesignKit](git@github.com:meetalva/designkit.git) if you don't access to a compatible pattern library.


## Pattern Library Requirements

> See [Alva DesignKit](https://github.com/meetalva/designkit) for a compatible project setup

* **Language**: TypeScript
* **View Library**: React
* Must be a valid NPM package exporting components via a central entry point

> :information_source: We plan to support more technologies and setups in the future.


## Pattern Requirements

* **Language**: TypeScript
* **View Library**: React

* Must be reachable from the central package entry point
* Must be exported via `export`
* Must by typed as `React.SFC`, `React.ComponentClass`, `React.PureComponent`, `React.StatelessComponent`, `React.SFC`, `React.ComponentType`
* Must be built with `declarations`, so a `index.d.ts` is available
* In order to accept children elements in Alva, the `children` prop has to be typed explicitly

* Supported property types are
  * string
  * number
  * boolean
  * enum

## Pattern Meta Data

### Pattern
* **name**: TSDoc `@name [name]` - Used as the pattern name
* **description**: TSDoc `@description [description]` - Used as subline for the pattern
* **icon**: TSDoc `@icon [icon]` - Used to show an icon from [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/). Case sensitive, use e.g. 'Archive'.
* **ignore**: TSDoc `@ignore` - Do not show this pattern

### Pattern Property

* **name**: TSDoc `@name [name]` - Used in the property pane as input label
* **default**: TSDoc `@default [value]` - Preset value for this property when creating new elements
* **description**: TSDoc `@description [description]` - Used as help text in property pane
* **example**: TSDoc `@example [value]` - Example used as input placeholder if applicable
* **ignore**: TSDoc `@ignore` - Do not show this property
