## Setup for contributors

To add a contribution to Alva (improve its features, fix issues),
get the source of the application itself, and if you don't already have a Alva compatible styleguide, the kickstart styleguide (designkit):

1. Clone the [alva](https://github.com/meetalva/alva) repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:meetalva/alva.git
```

2. Run in the main (Alva) repository:

```shell
npm i && npm start
```

3. Now open a compatible styleguide.

If you don't have a compatible styleguide, follow the next steps:

1. Clone the [designkit](https://github.com/meetalva/designkit) repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:meetalva/designkit.git
```

2. Run this command to build the designkit for Alva:

```shell
npm i && npm build
```

3. Now you should be able to open the designkit inside Alva

## Typedoc

To generate a Typedoc documentation of all classes, run

```
npm run docs
```

then open [build/docs/globals.html](build/docs/globals.html) in your browser.

## Issues

### Good first contribution

A good first contribution could be

* reporting a bug
* create a feature request
* work on an issue with the label [good first issue](https://github.com/meetalva/alva/labels/good%20first%20issue)

### Labels

* _good first issue_ - if you are new to _Alva_ or open source this could be a good first issue
* _help wanted_ - issue where we need help
* _type: bug_ - issue for an error/ failure of Alva
* _type: feature_ - issue for feature request
* _type: design_ - issue for a design todo
* _type: documentation_ - issue for needed, missing or unclear documentation
* _type: feedback_ - issue for feedback and task where we need to figure out if it's a bug or we want it as a feature (or something else)
* _type: question_ - issue for open question (most of the time, they need to be answered by core team)
* _status: in progress_ - issue is currently in progress
* _status: has PR_ - issue has already an open pull request
* _priority: low_ - issue which is a nice to have, like a backlog issue
* _priority: mid_ - issue needed in the near future, but not super urgent
* _priority: high_ - issue must be resolved as soon as possible

### Working on issues

Issues should be provided as branches starting with "feat/", as pull requests.

## Coding conventions & guidelines

### TypeScript & TSLint

We use strict tsconfig and TSLint rules, as well as Prettier. When it comes to naming things, we follow the [TypeScript guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines), and we do not abbreviate names (except for trivial names like HTML).

### We use .editorconfig

Editorconfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.
There are a lot of plugins for editors/IDEs that support .editorconfig.

You'll find more information, extensions for editors and IDEs at the [editorconfig page](http://editorconfig.org/).

## Commit message conventions

For commit messages we use the [angular commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits).

As tools, we use [commitlint](https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint) and [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).
