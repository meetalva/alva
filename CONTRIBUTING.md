## Setup for contributers
To add a contribution to Alva (improve its features, fix issues),
get the source of the application itself, and if you donÂ´t already have a Alva compatible styleguide, the kickstart styleguide (designkit):

1. Clone the [alva](https://github.com/meetalva/alva) repository:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:meetalva/alva.git
```
2. Run in the main (Alva) respository:
```shell
npm i && npm start
```

3. Now open a compatible styleguide.

If you donÂ´t have any, follow the next steps
1. Clone the [designkit](https://github.com/meetalva/designkit) repository:
	```shell
	git clone git@github.com:meetalva/designkit.git
	```
2. Run this command to build the designkit for Alva:
	```shell
	npm i && npm start
	```
	Now you should be able to open the designkit inside Alva

## Style Guide / Coding conventions
### Coding conventions & guidelines
#### TypeScript & TSLint
We use strict tsconfig and TSLint rules, as well as Prettier. When it comes to naming things, we follow the [TypeScript guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines), and we do not abbreviate names (except for trivial names like HTML).

#### We use .editorconfig
Editorconfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.
There are a lot of plugins for editors/IDEs that support .editorconfig.

You'll find more informations, extentions for editors and IDEs at the [editorconfig page](http://editorconfig.org/).


### Commit message conventions
For commit message we use the [angular commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits)
#### commitizen & commitlint
https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint
https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli
